# Numerical-Linear-Algebra-Parallel-Computing

**Course Description**
This course is an introduction to numerical Linear Algebra and HPC, The topics of this course are numerical algorithms for solving problems in Linear Algebra and optimizations techniques using the Python languages and its libraries.

**Duration:**
4 sessions can be extended to 6 sessions

**Requirements:**
- Elementary linear algebra.
- Intermediate level of programming in Python

**Homework & Programs**
Before each session, you will be given some easy exercises just to prepare yourself
for the session. The session itself consists of a lecture part and a lab part.
you will learn new concepts during lecture, then you apply them in the Lab.
During the lab, you will have to solve exercises in a timely manner so we could correct
them together. This will also be your opportunity to ask your questions.
After the session you will be given homework which is due for the next session.

- PreSession exercises
- Course (about 1 hour)
- Course Lab (about 2 hours)
- Assignments *graded*

**Academic Honor Policy / Code Honesty**
Mohammed VI polytechnic is built upon a strong foundation of integrity, respect and trust.
All members of the university have a responsibility to be honest and the right to expect honesty from others.
Any form of academic dishonesty is unacceptable to our community
**N.B** *You must work alone on all tests and exams. Any cheating will be handled with appropriate University action.*
